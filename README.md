The Shoreline Vulnerability Index helps figure out how different shoreline types around the Bay may be vulnerable to erosion and flooding. The SVI helps inform sea level rise adaptation planning. Shoreline adaptation projects will involve both maintaining and strengthening existing shorelines, as well as realigning and redesigning areas of the Bay shoreline. Understanding where stretches of the Bay's shoreline are highly vulnerable to flooding and sea level rise can inform the prioritization, planning, and construction of shoreline protection projects.
